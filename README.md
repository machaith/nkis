New Kali Installation Script

This script will be used to install needed tools and updates on new installations of kali linux 

#I do not recommend using this tool if you are a beginner, you will learn better if you did everything by your self

This script will automate updating, installing VirtualBox Guest editions/VMware tools and a lot of pentesting tools, useful if you had to install a new machine

start by nkis.sh if this is a new machine
otherwise if you only want the tools, run the install_tools.sh directly

any comments or recommended editions or modification are welcome :)
